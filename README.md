Adjusted Theme: Obsidian Shadows
Realistic post-volcanic eruption region: Ash-covered landscapes from a massive eruption 20 years ago. Themes: Survival in ruined ecosystems, human betrayal (e.g., rival factions exploiting Pokémon for resources), moral ambiguity (e.g., poaching vs. conservation), Pokémon exploitation (forced labor in rebuilding efforts). No sci-fi; grounded in natural disaster aftermath.

Key Elements Changing
Region (Volcanara): 8 gyms, Elite Four, post-game islands. Starter town: Ashfall Village (ruined hamlet). End: Summit Citadel (volcano peak).
Towns/Cities (8 main + side):
Ashfall Village: Starter, professor's lab (focus on survival research).
Ember Town: First gym (Fire-type, leader exploits Pokémon for mining).
Dusthaven: Port city, smuggling hub.
Riftburg: Canyon town, betrayal plot twist.
Lavaflow City: Industrial, exploitation theme.
Shadowridge: Mountain village, moral choices.
Obsidian Port: Coastal, rival confrontations.
Volcan Peak: Final gym, ancient ruins.
Side: Ruined Outposts (exploration), Hidden Caves (secrets).
Maps/Routes: 15 routes + dungeons. Edits: Volcanic terrain (ash tiles, lava hazards). Routes connect towns logically; add obstacles (rockslides, ash storms affecting movement).
Scripts/Storyline: Darker plot: Player rebuilds region while uncovering exploitation ring. Beats:
Intro: Eruption flashback, choose starter (adapted to survival: resilient Pokémon).
Mid: Betrayal by ally turning poacher.
Climax: Confront faction leader using exploited legendaries.
Post-game: Ethical dilemmas in rebuilding.
Mature elements: Dialogues on loss (e.g., Pokémon deaths implied), ambiguity (no clear heroes).
NPCs/Characters:
Professor Ash: Mentor, haunted by past failures.
Rival: Ambitious betrayer, exploits Pokémon for power.
Gym Leaders: 8, themed on survival (e.g., Fire, Rock, Poison types; backstories of loss).
Villain Team: "Shadow Syndicate" – Poachers/exploiters, 5 admins with moral gray areas.
Other NPCs: 100+ new, with dialogues reflecting themes (survivors, traders, ethicists).
Battles/Difficulty/AI:
Increased levels: Gyms 10-15% higher; wild Pokémon scaled.
Smarter AI: Edit to predict switches, use items strategically, prioritize status moves.
Boss fights: Multi-Pokémon, weather effects (ash = custom hazard).
Changes: Higher EV/IV for foes, rare held items.
Other Changes: Text edits for tone; minor tile/graphics tweaks (if files provided); no Pokémon changes (keep Gen 3 roster).
